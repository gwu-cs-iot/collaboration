# Paper repository

You should be able to find the `pdf`s for the class in the directory.
The presenter of each paper should upload the paper's `pdf` here.
The naming scheme must be followed and is: `confXXname.pdf`.
`conf` is the abbreviation for the conference or journal the paper appeared in.
`XX` is the year, for example, `19` for papers published in 2019.
`name` is a small collection of lower-case words describing the paper (separated by `_`s.
For example, a paper that creates a system called "Chaos" would have `name` = `chaos`.
For example, our work on Chaos, published in RTAS in 2019 has been named `rtas19chaos.pdf`.
