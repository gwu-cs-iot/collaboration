# Spring '20: *Internet of Things - systems and security*

This class effectively has two class structures.

1. Instruction - We'll discuss the major concepts relevant for the IoT that will give you a broad background, but not much depth.
    The goal is to make you *aware* of the core concepts and solutions so that you'll know where to look when you have a problem.
1. Research discussions - Students will present research papers, and we will discuss them.
    The goal is to learn about cutting-edge research, and to practice both digesting it and presenting it.
