- Smart watch designed using BLE and adafruit microcontroller. The following example does not use a powerful microcontroller, and currently only has wifi capabilities, which presents a good opportunity to expand its capabilities. A small microphone can be added, as well as an IR blaster. https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Smartwatch-Using-ESP8266/
- [Pi-Hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) is an open-source, Raspberry Pi based project that allows you to block ad servers and prevent web ads from even reaching your devices. The Pi-Hole works across your home network and can even block ads on devices like smart TVs with no native support for an ad-blocker.
- Enhance your morning routine by using a smart [mirror](https://www.pantechsolutions.net/iot-based-smart-e-mirror-using-opencv-with-raspberry-pi) to display the date, time, weather, to do list, and more. System requires a Raspberry Pi, transparent mirror, frames, and/or speakers.
- Automated bullseye [dartboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHTizZ_XcUM). Mark Rober has created a system that allows every person to always, or nearly always, hit a bullseye when playing darts. The system uses a set of cameras, 6 stepper motors, and a software develop using matlab to esetimate where that dart will hit and move the board to that position in less than 400ms. The other cool thing is that depending on the dart you use, you will go from always hitting a bullseye to not being able to even hit the board!
- Smart [refrigerator](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322653199_IoT_Based_Interactive_Smart_Refrigerator) research paper that proposes a refrigerator that tracks the freshness and amount of food being stored inside and sends updates/reminders to the owener with a mobile application
- IoT-enabled board game; [this one uses two physical chess boards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta-q7Qbpj4Q), but the idea could be used to connect a single game board for something more elaborate like [Settlers of Catan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/catan) to a computer or server which hosts an [AI player](https://github.com/maxyurk/settlers_of_catan)
- DIY [air filter](https://github.com/Kels316/DIY-Air-Purifier). What could we do with it once connected to internet/phone, and what sensors should be added?
- "Bodyhacking" [This guy uses an implant to make a gun safer](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pgkz8y/biohacking-smart-guns-RFID-implants-amal-graafstra), but these low power implants have many applications in security and home/applience improvement.
- Business card that runs linux on it for some [reason]( https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/my-business-card-runs-linux/)
- [TinySDR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02063.pdf) Proposed Software defined radio platform for LoRa and BLE and can be programmed over the air
- IoT Connected [picture frame](https://www.instructables.com/id/IoT-Location-Sensing-Picture-Frame/). Something along these lines but could be modified to keep tabs on family members and differentiate between locations (like school, home, work, etc.) and then could also implement some mobile interface for notifying the "head of house" when people aren't somewhere they should be.
- Mini Printer (https://www.instructables.com/id/Homemade-arduino-printer/) the Internet portion could be used so files from Google Drive or Dropbox like sites could be printed
- Drones are cool! But their use is limited due to a restrictive weight limit. RC cars, on the other hand, have much more flexible weight requirements, as they don't have to fly. Drone [charging pads](https://www.skysense.co/) exist as a way to "wirelessly" charge drones, so what if you put one on an RC car? Then you have a car that can charge and deploy a drone, combining the benefits of drones and cars.
- [A robot that shines a laser in your eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8zC3-ZQFJI)- was improved/expanded to detect his face on stream whenever someone subscribed in subsequent videos on his channel.
- The [Doomsday Clock](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/) is a symbol created by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists to track geopolitical risk. The clock value is only set once per year. It was originally 100% based on nuclear weapons, but now tracks other major sources of geopolitical risk, such as climate change. Develop a Smart Doomsday Clock that sets itself annually querying and setting this value and then going dormant for a long period of time. How can you design this to work for 10 years + without changing batteries
- There are many enthusiasts that run emulated systems, such as the PDP-11, with classic versions of Unix. These are typically emulated on Raspberry Pi's and may even have full-featured consoles with Blinkenlights. For example, see the [PiDP-11](https://obsolescence.wixsite.com/obsolescence/pidp-11) or [Altair-duino](https://www.adwaterandstir.com/altair/). Use one of these kits to power an interactive art project inspired by the early Unix hacker community or the Homebrew Computer Club.
- Smart Homes are often powered by hubs like [Samsung SmartThings](https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-home/smartthings/hubs/samsung-smartthings-hub--2018--gp-u999sjvlgda/) or the [Alexa Smart Home](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smarthome/echo-plus-zigbee-support.html), which bridge IP networks with specialized networks such as ZigBee or Z-Wave. Some of these hubs also act as an edge computing device for the smart home. Build one of these from scratch, using recent innovations from research.
- IoT enabled prosthetics. We can detect electrical impulses from limb ends non-invasively. Then upload the data into a cloud and use ML to infer which action was intended. This would probablt also include signal processing.
- Color changing [jewelry/acessories](https://www.instructables.com/id/BT-Controlled-LED-Wearable-With-Intel-Edison/). Changes based on the user command but it could be further extended to maybe the temperature of the room or the ambience/brightness of the current environment
- Brain-controlled [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSKBtEBRWi4) (through a prosthesis)
