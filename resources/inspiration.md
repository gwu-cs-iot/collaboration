- The [F1/10](http://f1tenth.org/) competition has everything you need to make a 1/10 scale, autonomous racer.
  What if we wanted to make one of these using _distributed_ sensors, instead of an expensive LIDAR sensor?
  What if we wanted to make multiple vehicles communicate?
- The making and design processes behind the [deadmau5 cube v3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waGzVes6PWY) which uses embedded physical control to create a sound-interactive viewing experience.
- Taking instruments [beyond MIDI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5MuKTkukIw), and creating a suite of sound-control instruments based around highly physical interactivity.
- Taking the classical [inverted pendumlum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Owe0o0ynUbY) problem to the realm of cheap mobility with `edumips`.

- Using the voice control APIs of existing human-interactive cloud systems to [control your computer](https://www.instructables.com/id/IoTyper-Control-Your-PC-Via-Alexa-IoT/)
- Rethink something as simple as the [lighting](https://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Simple-RGB-WiFi-Lamp/) of an environment.
  Super-cool when combined with sensors to change the lights interactively.
- [Sound source localization](https://respeaker.io/6_mic_array/) ([2](https://respeaker.io/usb_4_mic_array/)) is an amazing capability to ascertain the direction of sound relative to an embedded system.
  How could you use this creatively?
- Really into [craps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps), or role playing, but always felt like your dice [needed more bling](https://hackaday.io/project/28377-electronic-dice) -- or to interact with the users?
- Much of the future of embedded system is untethered and solar.
  To make that a reality, you need a [capable battery](https://hackaday.io/project/164733-pisugar-battery-for-raspberry-pi-zero).

- Are there better ways to control traffic lights other than (illegal) [MiRTs](https://hackaday.io/project/162434-dont-call-the-cops) [(2)](http://www.themirt.com/how-it-works.php)? Related: how the doppler effect and other techniques are used in police [radar](https://youtu.be/vQtLms02PFM?t=647).
- What could you do with a [cheap infrared camera](https://youtu.be/u4DSzp77xwk?t=162)?
- Tangible [wave and beat shaping](https://youtu.be/Mgy1S8qymx0?list=TLPQMDIwMTIwMjDft11QejRomA).
- Simple [door alarm](https://youtu.be/xXs8Cxw4e2k?list=TLPQMDQwMTIwMjCFXJiZsHM4tw). Why not add face or bluetooth (for a specific smart phone) detection?
- Shooting a water cannon at [cats](https://youtu.be/uIbkLjjlMV8?list=TLPQMDQwMTIwMjCFXJiZsHM4tw)? Why not?
- Pezioelectric sensors are great for getting feedback from the environment.
  Use them to detect vibrations when [building an electric instrument](https://youtu.be/Zp2LCAv2CYY?list=TLPQMDQwMTIwMjCFXJiZsHM4tw&t=408), fit them into a glove to [play music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTJh_Kph1mU&list=TLPQMDQwMTIwMjCFXJiZsHM4tw&index=16), or power a small [system](https://youtu.be/tYoGdxDPwL4?list=TLPQMDQwMTIwMjCFXJiZsHM4tw).
- Patients with head and neck cancer use wearable [tech](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20180517/Smart-technology-helps-improve-outcomes-for-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancer.aspx) (bluetooth enabled scale, bluetooth enabled blood pressure cuff and mobile app) to send information to their physician to see how they are responding to treatment.
- Our dairy life optimization of energy efficiency can be accomplished by IoT ["Smart Home" Energy Efficient IoT Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCgf_YmOykw). For making the smart house, many types of sensors and management systems are needed. Thanks to the smart home, we can save energy without additional individual effort!
- New [wearable device](https://spirehealth.com/pages/research-platform) to monitor respiration, pulse, sleep, and activity to help with health conditions including asthma, anxiety, sleep disorders and more.
- Mesh that [athletes](https://electronicsforu.com/electronics-projects/wifi-bluetooth-mesh-enabled-iot-smart-device-for-athletes) can wear to get readings on how their body responds to certain situations in whatever sport they play
- Smart watch designed using BLE and adafruit microcontroller. The following example does not use a powerful microcontroller, and currently only has wifi capabilities, which presents a good opportunity to expand its capabilities. A small microphone can be added, as well as an IR blaster. https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Smartwatch-Using-ESP8266/
- [Pi-Hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) is an open-source, Raspberry Pi based project that allows you to block ad servers and prevent web ads from even reaching your devices. The Pi-Hole works across your home network and can even block ads on devices like smart TVs with no native support for an ad-blocker.
- Enhance your morning routine by using a smart [mirror](https://www.pantechsolutions.net/iot-based-smart-e-mirror-using-opencv-with-raspberry-pi) to display the date, time, weather, to do list, and more. System requires a Raspberry Pi, transparent mirror, frames, and/or speakers.
- Automated bullseye [dartboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHTizZ_XcUM). Mark Rober has created a system that allows every person to always, or nearly always, hit a bullseye when playing darts. The system uses a set of cameras, 6 stepper motors, and a software develop using matlab to esetimate where that dart will hit and move the board to that position in less than 400ms. The other cool thing is that depending on the dart you use, you will go from always hitting a bullseye to not being able to even hit the board!
- Smart [refrigerator](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322653199_IoT_Based_Interactive_Smart_Refrigerator) research paper that proposes a refrigerator that tracks the freshness and amount of food being stored inside and sends updates/reminders to the owener with a mobile application
- IoT-enabled board game; [this one uses two physical chess boards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta-q7Qbpj4Q), but the idea could be used to connect a single game board for something more elaborate like [Settlers of Catan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/catan) to a computer or server which hosts an [AI player](https://github.com/maxyurk/settlers_of_catan)
- DIY [air filter](https://github.com/Kels316/DIY-Air-Purifier). What could we do with it once connected to internet/phone, and what sensors should be added?
- IoT enabled prosthetics. We can detect electrical impulses from limb ends non-invasively. Then upload the data into a cloud and use ML to infer which action was intended. This would probablt also include signal processing.
